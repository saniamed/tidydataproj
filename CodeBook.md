## CODE BOOK FOR TIDY DATA


The tidy data is created by manipulating data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

### Explanation of data

the experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

### Steps taken to form tidy dataset
In this tidy data set I have merged the test and training data sets. Then I selected the data columns containing mean and standard deviation of measurements. I added appropriate descriptive variable (column) names. Then I took the mean of each variable by subject and activity. The end result is a tidy data set where each row is for a given subject and a given activity. So there are 6 rows per subject (corresponding to the six activities). Since there are 30 subjects in total, the tidy data set has 180 rows. 


#### Explanation of Data Variables

~~~
The variables are named like this:

sub_id: id code that uniquely identifies each subject
type: numeric
Min: 1
Max: 30

activity: 6 labels for 6 types of activities

t -- prefix t stands for time and shows time domain signals which were captured at constant rate of 50 Hz.
tbodyaccxyz -- body acceleration signals
tgravityaccxyz -- gravitational acceleration signals
tbodyaccjerkxyz -- body's linear acceleration jerk signals
tbodygyrojerkxyz -- angular velocity jerk signals 
tbodyaccmag -- Euclidean norm of acceleration signals
tgravityaccmag -- Euclidean norm of gravitational acceleration signals
